#### ğŸŒ» Howdy! Iâ€™m @shavonnedenise and welcome to my GitHub profile âœ¨ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒˆğŸ¦‹
#### ğŸŒ» I'm just your totally ordinary, only sometimes extra but just the right amount, incredibly hilarious, (almost) pyschologist turned software developer
#### ğŸŒ» Coding is fun âœ¨butâœ¨ I also enjoy roller skating, traveling, going to concerts/festivals, and binge-watching my latest favorite YA Netflix show (#noshame)
#### ğŸŒ» I'm all about expanding my brain juices so if you're well versed in any of the following (machine learning, data analytics, python, and honestly whatever else gets you excited!) then I would love to connect and learn more!
#### ğŸŒ» Don't be shy - you can find me on the Twitter @obicodekenobi
